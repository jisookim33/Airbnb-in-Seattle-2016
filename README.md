# Airbnb in Seattle: 2016

### Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of Airbnb activity in Seattle during the year 2016. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I analyzed key metrics including the number of listings, nightly pricing trends, and weekly revenue. The goal was to uncover insights into host behavior, market dynamics, and pricing strategies. Tableau was used to create interactive visualizations that clearly communicate findings to a non-technical audience.
